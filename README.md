The project does this by using data analysis methods that include data description, data diagnostics, and data prediction.

## Introduction
Juvenile crime occurs when an individual under the age of majority acts against the law. For minor offenses, the juvenile might also be released to the custody of a parent or legal guardian (Baugh,2023). A child is defined as a person under the age of 18 years(Child Act 2001).A child under the age of 10 years is not deemed to be criminally responsible for their actions(Section 82, Penal Code). Juvenile crime is a major cause for concern in Malaysia. In order to address this problem, a thorough understanding of the interactions relating to age and gender that affect juvenile crime rates must be developed. 

## Methodology
### 1. Data Description
Data description is the process of describing and giving an overview of a dataset’s main attributes and characterisitics. It is an important phase in the workflow for data analysis and data science because it enables researchers, analysts, and decision-makers to understand the data they are using. The following characteristics are generally included of data description:

a. data size –describes the volume of data usually measured in rows and column. For this dataset, there are 9 rows of types of crime, 8 rows of age range and gender.
b. data types-identifies the data type as numerical, categorical, to understand the nature of data.
c. summary statistics- basic statistical measures like mean,median,minimum,maximum values for numerical variables
d. data distributions
e. missing values
f. data visualization
